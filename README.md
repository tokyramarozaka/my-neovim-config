# My Neovim Config

This is just a backup of my neovim config which uses lazy.nvim, which is essentially a copy of Josean Martinez's config with a few minor tweaks :
1. added Java;
2. changed the `mason.lua` and `lspconfig.lua` files to fix a cyclic dependency bug on my windows 10.
3. added Emmet support just like in VsCode

As mentionned, this is a based upon Josean Martinez's awesome guide into neovim for 2024, you can check his amazing video down below for a thorough explanation of everything in there.
